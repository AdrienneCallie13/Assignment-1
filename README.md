Summary:

Travel websites provide as a platform for destination management corporations to supplant local travel agencies. The goal of travel websites is to give information on tourist destinations, whether they be local or worldwide. When arranging vacations to places users are unfamiliar with, users may need to do some research. Users can book transportation, day tours, restaurants, and accommodations. Because it employs responsive design techniques, this website is also accessible on a broad range of devices.

UX/UI design

To have visual aesthetic website, there are few colours schemes that I’m going to implement them on my website. 

<img width="422" alt="Screen Shot 2021-08-09 at 10 14 30 am" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87454125/128650673-9dde6e1a-efa5-486e-9d8b-61b8de1c6acc.png"> color palette.

The main colour of the website will be the #807C82 and #D9D3D1. Instead of using black and white, I used slightly light black colour and fade white to avoid boring and eye-hurting interface. Beside colours, I also consider using illustration to styling the website.  

The most important UI/UX feature is the functionality. Because it is a travel service website, it will have a lot of functionality such as search engine, navigation bar for accessing the information, and buttons. I aim to have multi-pages HTML, so the homepage is the main page of the website with lots of pages link to it. Using CSS to build a card layout and media object will be applied after the landing page.

On this first version proposal, I have created four UI designs for both mobile and web on Figma.
